Python Challenge
For the PyBank challenge we were asked to analyze a dataset for the duration of the data in months, the totals of the profits and losses and use those to calculate the biggest increase and decreases in profit with corresponding dates. We were also asked to find the average of the profits or losses over that duration of the dataset.
For the PyPoll challenge were asked to analyze the datase for the election data of 3 candidates by calculating the total number of votes cast and find out which candidate received how many votes by raw count as well as the precent of the total number of votes cast. After analyzing the data we were asked to give the winner of the election.
Using the class activities including the powerpoints and the lectures along, a tutoring session, stackoverflow, udemy, geeksforgeek, my brother in law who works as a data analyst and classmates I was able to complete the assignment. Also hours and hours of google searching and clicking through helpful and sometimes not very helpful website helped me in the completion of the homework.
